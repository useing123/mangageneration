# MangaGeneration

MangaGeneration is a project that utilizes machine learning to generate unique manga-style images. This project is perfect for manga enthusiasts, artists looking for inspiration, or developers wanting to integrate manga-style images into their applications.

## Features

- Generate unique manga-style images
- Control the generation process with various parameters
- Download the generated images for personal use
- Integrate with other applications through a simple API

## Installation

To install MangaGeneration, you need to have Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine. You can install the project and its dependencies using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/useing123/mangageneration.git
cd mangageneration
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#Usage

After installing the project, you can start generating manga-style images. Here is a basic example:

```
from mangageneration import MangaGenerator

generator = MangaGenerator()
image = generator.generate()
image.show()
```

You can also control the generation process with various parameters:
```
image = generator.generate(style='shoujo', characters=2, setting='school')
```
#API

MangaGeneration also provides a simple API that you can use to integrate manga-style image generation into your own applications. Here is an example of how to use the API:
```
from mangageneration import MangaGeneratorAPI

api = MangaGeneratorAPI()
response = api.generate(style='shoujo', characters=2, setting='school')
image = response.get_image()
```
